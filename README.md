# simplex

Let's simplify our relationship with social media by cutting the interactions in "half".

Depends on `t`, `toot`, and `bksy`. it's on you to procure those clients and perform the initial authentication process.

The shell script in this repository is very simple, so you can easily comment out or add new clients based on your needs.
